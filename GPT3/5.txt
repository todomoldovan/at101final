Reimagine:
It is a dark time for the Rebellion. 

Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them to the the remote ice world of Hoth.

Lord Vader, Chancellor Palpatine and the Emperor met in an underground room deep in the Imperial Palace on Coruscant. The Emperor is uncharacteristically uncloaked for this highly secure meeting.

tl;dr:  The Empire has discovered the Rebel base on Hoth and is sending probe droids to investigate.
The players are Rebel soldiers stationed on Hoth. They are part of a small scouting party that has been sent to investigate a mysterious object that has been detected on the planet.

Simplify: The rebels were hiding in a secret base, but the Empire found them and chased them away. Now they're on a new planet, Hoth. Darth Vader is trying to find Luke Skywalker, and he's sending out probes to look for him.
