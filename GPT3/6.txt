Luke Skywalker has returned to
his home planet of Tatooine in
an attempt to rescue his
friend Han Solo from the
clutches of the vile gangster
Jabba the Hutt.

Little does Luke know that the
GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
begun construction on a new
armored space station even
more powerful than the first
dreaded Death Star.

When completed, this ultimate
weapon will spell certain doom
for the small band of rebels
struggling to restore freedom
to the galaxy...

Reimagine:
Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine for five reasons:

To rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt

Clues have been given that a new, heavily armored space station is being constructed, one that will be even more powerful than the first Death Star

He learns that he is the Chosen One prophesied to bring balance to the galaxy

The Rebels are being hunted down relentlessly

And to visit his childhood friend, moisture farmer Owen Lars

tl;dr:   The Empire has built a new Death Star. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO have to destroy it.

Simplify: Luke's friend is a prisoner on a
spaceship. It is a bad spaceship.
Luke has a friend named Leia.
Leia wants Luke to help her.
She says Luke must help her because
the bad spaceship is going to hurt
her friends
